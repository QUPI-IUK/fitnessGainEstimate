<b>Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 fitness gains from genomic surveillance data without prior lineage classification</b>

This contains the code to produce SARS-CoV-2 fitness gain estimates based on GISAID data. It is written as an R script, with main.R containing the main script. It further requires a multi-sequence alignment available from GISAID, as well as all metadata for the used isolates for the sensitivity analysis (for submission date and Pango lineage assignment). 

This is part of the following manuscript: [reference to be added]
